Paul Boniol, a researcher at Inria and a member of the VALDA project-team, stands at the forefront of data science and computational research. With a Ph.D. earned at the University of Paris and EDF R&D, collaborating with luminaries such as Prof. Themis Palpanas, Emmanuel Remy, and Mohammed Meftah, Paul's academic journey also includes a Postdoctoral research role at Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) Paris Saclay, working with Prof. Laurent Oudre. Enriching his expertise through an internship at the University of Chicago under the guidance of Prof. Michael J. Franklin and Prof. John Paparrizos, Paul's foundational education in computer science and applied mathematics at Grenoble INP ENSIMAG engineering school has been pivotal. His earlier contributions as a research engineer at the computer science lab of Ecole Polytechnique, collaborating with Prof. Michalis Vazirgiannis’s team, reflect his commitment to advancing the frontiers of computational research and data science.
