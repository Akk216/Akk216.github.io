Leveraging surgical simulators for building True Automation to ensure aspects of increased robustness and safety

• Integrated and improved LapGym-SOFA simulator to emulate RosPy Publisher & Subscriber for efficient task control by LLM\
• Combined 7+ surgical tasks, reduced the latency & improved realism by utilizing image based-RL techniques\
• Improved existing AMBF-RL simulator by building an image extraction pipeline for RL & a universal controller for all robots
