## VUS Range based Time Series-Anomaly Detection metric:
Achieved 5X optimization of VUS-Anomaly Detection (AD) metric by strategic enhancements in calculation methodologies

• Provided algorithmic and conceptual improvements, for reducing time and space complexity by a quadratic factor\
• Obtained a fivefold runtime reduction using efficient data structures, producing runtimes similar to the Range-AUC metric\
• Created run-time and robustness study for Synthetic and TSB-UAD Benchmark by balancing loads across 3 Dino servers using 10+ AD models including Isolation Forest, Robust covariance, SVMs & synthetically generated near-perfect/worst models

## Series2Graph Time Series Classification:
• Employed Series2Graph to obtain time series features as graphs for UCR-2018 to produce Explainable-Graph classification\
• Currently tuning the modified Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) for Weighted-Directed Graphs using torch geometric
