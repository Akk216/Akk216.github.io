Classification of Colloidal Drop Drying Pattern using Large Vision Models

2.1. Generated Synthetic Data using OpenCV, along with data augmentation due to lack of experimental input data. \
2.2. Transfer Learning to adapt pre-trained vision models for the classification task and fine-tuning on experimental data.
